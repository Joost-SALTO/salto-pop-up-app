# Mobile boilerplate (WIP, not usable yet)

This is a fully ready react-native project that can be used for developing. If you wish to create your own opinion-less project and just use features like TypeScript, you can refer to the [react-native guides at Lifely Docs](https://docs.lifely.nl/development/react-native/REACT_NATIVE.html) to get you started.

The intention is to keep this boilerplate up to date with the newest versions of React and React-Native as they are being released.
